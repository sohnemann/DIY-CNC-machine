# Dust shoe

The purpose of a dust shoe is to collect the dust generated by the CNC machine. Ivan's original dust shoe didn't fit my router, thus I designed a new dust shoe using a brush.

To not have to reprint the router bracket, I manually cut of the blocking piece from it. The STL/OBJ router bracket file in this repo is redesigned and updated, so no manual cutting should be needed.

The brush slot at the bottom of the vaccum funnel (**P34**) was measured and the brush (**O27**) was cut at an appropriate length. The brush was then inserted into the slot. As the fit was very tight, no glue was needed.

The vaccum funnel (**P34**) was placed next to the router bracket (**P24**) and a pen was used to indicate how much of the router bracket that was to be removed.

A hand-held Fein multitool was used to remove the blocking piece from the router bracket. A sand paper was used to smooth out the edges.

The vaccum funnel was then attached to the router bracket and a scissor was used to cut the brush at an appropriate length.

1x 80 mm M5 screw (**S17**) and 1x M5 nut (**N02**) was used to lock the vaccum funnel in place.
