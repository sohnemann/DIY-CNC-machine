## Wasteboard

### Cut out wasteboard

The length and width of the CNC was measured and a 12 mm plywood (**O26**) was cut out using a vertical panel saw. If you don't have a vertical panel saw, a jigsaw or a circular saw works as well.

### Attach wasteboard to CNC

The wasteboard was placed underneath the CNC machine. 7x 3d-printed wasteboard brackets (**P37**), 14x 3.5x20mm screws (**S01**) and 14x (15mm x 5mm x 1mm) washers (**W02**) were used to to keep the wasteboard in place.
