# DIY-CNC-machine

![main_gif](./images/main_gif.gif)

This guide goes through all the steps to build your own CNC machine from scratch. It includes a complete bill of materials (BOM), STL/OBJ-files for all the 3d-printed parts and detailed instructions of how everything is assembled. It also includes instructions of how all the necessary open-source softwares are installed.

The guide is based on Ivan Miranada's design and is a complement to Ivan's Youtube-videos:

## License
The following license is included when buying Ivan Miranda's blueprints of the CNC machine:

```
Everything that is in these files that I produced myself, apart from reselling the files, is allowed.
You can print and sell parts, sell machines, sell courses to build the machine. Modify the parts and post 
them for free, as long as you don’t sell the files and keep this license on everything you make with the 
files and credit me, we’re good. No DRM or anything, you are even allowed to repost the files as long as 
they’re kept free. Why buy this then? To support me and keep me encouraged to do more projects like this. 
```

Ivan does an amazing job putting these DIY builds together. I've posted his STL-files in this repository to simplify the build, but PLEASE buy his blueprints here: [https://ivanmiranda.com/products/3d-printed-cnc](https://ivanmiranda.com/products/3d-printed-cnc). It's only \$25 and helps him to continue build and share his awesome projects. Also, you will get access to a Discord channel that is really useful, where you can ask questions to a lot of people who have already built the machine.

Also, the Z-axis end-stop trigger, the ordinary end-stops and the rail supports all come from cello4's GitHub: [https://github.com/4cello/mirandacnc-community](https://github.com/4cello/mirandacnc-community).

## Parts (bill of materials)

**CLICK HERE TO OPEN THE BILL OF MATERIALS (BOM) MARKDOWN: [Bill of materials](./BILLOFMATERIAL.md)**

To simplify the build, I've created a separate markdown page with tables covering all parts needed to build the CNC-machine. The tables include a unique `Item No.` to easier refer to the parts in the guide. The tables also include images of all parts and .STL/.OBJ files of the parts that needs to be 3d-printed.

To get an even better understanding of how all the parts are used, I've created a detailed spreadsheet with comments:

* [On Google drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VdnPilA22OfAh9a1y4Ft6c2xkio206Dzv85h7AX7CmQ/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Bill\_of\_material.xlsx](./Bill_of_material.xlsx)

**To be able to continue with the build, you need to buy and 3d-print all needed parts found in the [bill of materials](./BILLOFMATERIAL.md).**
